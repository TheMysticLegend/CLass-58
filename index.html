        <p>I love gaming. Gaming is this thing were you play multilayer in a screen. Pretty cool right? But not only gaming, but Youtube! Youtube is this social media that allows you to make videos and watch them. When I grow up, then im gonna be a youtuber, because if you upload a vid that get a million views, then you get money! Also, if you get enough subscribers, then you get this thing called a play button. Its a throphy-like thing that you get if you get a certain amount of subs. If you get 10,000 subs. Silver is 100,000 subs. Gold is 1,000,000 subs, and diamond is 10,000,000 subs. This is me about my hobby.</p>
